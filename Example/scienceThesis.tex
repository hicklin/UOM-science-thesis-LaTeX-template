If you take a look at science in its everyday function, of course you find that scientists run the gamut of human emotions and personalities and character and so on. But there's one thing that is really striking to the outsider, and that is the gauntlet of criticism that is considered acceptable or even desirable. The poor graduate student at his or her Ph.D. oral exam is subjected to a withering crossfire of questions that sometimes seem hostile or contemptuous; this from the professors who have the candidate's future in their grasp. The students naturally are nervous; who wouldn't be? True, they've prepared for it for years. But they understand that at that critical moment they really have to be able to answer questions. So in preparing to defend their theses, they must anticipate questions; they have to think,``Where in my thesis is there a weakness that someone else might find because I sure better find it before they do, because if they find it and I'm not prepared, I'm in deep trouble."\\

After your first job, is anyone asking you what your GPA was? No, they don't care. They ask you: Are you a good leader? Do people follow you? Do you have integrity? Are you innovative? Do you solve problems? Somebody's got to do that homework and redesign the educational system so that it can actually train people to be successful in life.\\
\\
I think the greatest teachers are not the ones that are best trained at educational tactics. I don't know a person who's ever said,``Boy, that teacher is so good! The teacher gives such good exams. That teacher gives such good homework sets!" No one has said that about a great teacher. That's not what people remember about the great teachers they've had.\\
\\
The best educators are the ones that inspire their students. That inspiration comes from a passion that teachers have for the subject they're teaching. Most commonly, that person spent their lives studying that subject, and they bring an infectious enthusiasm to the audience.\\
\\
I think many people have that enthusiasm, but they are prevented from being teachers because they didn't go through the teacher mill. Now you have teachers who have been through the teacher mill, yet they have no capacity to inspire anyone at all. It's the inspired student that continues to learn on their own. That's what separates the real achievers in the world from those who pedal along, finishing assignments.\\

\chapter{Introduction}

This template was generated according to the University of Malta, Department of Physics guidelines \cite{guidelines}. In the following chapters some examples regarding the use of this template and other common commands are illustrated. Most of this and other information can be acquired for the \LaTeX{} wiki books\footnote{\url{http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/}}.

To use abbreviations add the acronyms command with the \textit{acronyms.tex} file between the curly brackets. Add your abbreviations to the \textit{acronyms.tex} file using the command
\begin{code}
\newacronym{label}{abbreviation}{full_name}
e.x
\newacronym{pv}{PV}{Photovoltaic}
\end{code}
When you want to use the abbreviation use the commands

\begin{table}[h!]
\center
\begin{tabular}{l p{11cm}}
\verb|\gls{label}| & This command prints the term associated with $<$label$>$ passed as its argument.\\
\verb|\glspl{<label>}| & This command prints the plural of the defined therm, other than that it behaves in the same way as gls.\\
\verb|\Gls{<label>}| & This command prints the singular form of the term with the first character converted to upper case.\\
\verb|\Glspl{<label>}| & This command prints the plural form with first letter of the term converted to upper case.\\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The first time a the acronym is used it is axiomatically written as the full name with the abbreviation in parentheses. The rest of the time it is written as the abbreviation. To generate the acronym page, or refresh it, one has to execute the command

\begin{code}
makeglossaries <fileName>
\end{code}

from the terminal (unix) or cmd (windows). The following paragraph shows an example of how to use acronyms and how they are displayed.

\Glspl{dssc} are \gls{pv} cells using organic materials instead of \glspl{sc}. They usually use nano-particles of \gls{tio2} as a \gls{sc} to transfer electrons \cite{Gra91}.

The rest of the text is lorem ipsum, just to show the type-setting, with the exception of a few example showing you how to use various environments and commands.

\section{\LaTeX{} environments}

Table \ref{tab:ResitanceTable} is an example of both, how to create tables in \LaTeX{} and how to use cross-referencing. Equation \ref{eq:Schr} show the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, an example of how to write equations, and how to cross-reference equations \cite{Quantum}.

\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{c | c}
		I & $\Omega$ \\ \hline
		12 & 4 \\
		10 & 6 \\
		8 & 8 \\
		6 & 10 \\
	\end{tabular}
	\caption[short caption]{long caption}% short caption is optional and if filled is used in the table of contents.
	\label{tab:ResitanceTable}
\end{table}

\begin{equation}
i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 \psi + V(\mathbf{r})
\label{eq:Schr}
\end{equation}

Figure \ref{fig:WordVsLatex} show how to insert graphics in a \LaTeX{} documents and also how to cross-reference it.

\chapter{Chemistry examples}

The following are examples of how to use the \textit{mhchem} package.

\ce{^{227}_{90}Th+}, \ce{Ce^{IV}}, \ce{KCr(SO4)2.12H2O}, \ce{RNO2^{-.}}

\ce{H2 + 1/2O2 = H2O}

\ce{K3[Fe(CN)6] <=> 3K+ + [Fe(CN)6]-}

\ce{H+ + OH- <=>> H2O}

\ce{NH4NO3 + H2O ->[\Delta] NH4+_{(aq)} + NO3-_{(aq)}}

\ce{X=Y#Z}, \ce{CH3\sbond C\tbond C\dbond CH2}, \ce{A\bond{...}B}

\begin{equation}
\ce{AgCl <=> Ag+ + Cl-}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\ce{CO2 + 6H2O ->[\textcolor{blue}{Light Energy}][\textcolor{red}{Endothermic}] C6H12O6 + CO2 \quad \Delta G^{\circ}} = \SI{+2870}{kJ.mol^{-1}}
\end{equation}

\section{The listings environment}

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=left]
BEFOREHAND: close door, each window & exit; wait until time.
    open spellbook, study, read (scan, select, tell us);
write it, print the hex while each watches,
    reverse its length, write again;
    kill spiders, pop them, chop, split, kill them.
        unlink arms, shift, wait & listen (listening, wait),
sort the flock (then, warn the "goats" & kill the "sheep");
    kill them, dump qualms, shift moralities,
    values aside, each one;
        die sheep! die to reverse the system
        you accept (reject, respect);
next step,
    kill the next sacrifice, each sacrifice,
    wait, redo ritual until "all the spirits are pleased";
    do it ("as they say").
do it(*everyone***must***participate***in***forbidden**s*e*x*).
return last victim; package body;
    exit crypt (time, times & "half a time") & close it,
    select (quickly) & warn your next victim;
AFTERWORDS: tell nobody.
    wait, wait until time;
    wait until next year, next decade;
        sleep, sleep, die yourself,
        die at last
